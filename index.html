        <h2>Background</h2> 
        <p>I've been interested in web design the past two years but I've finally decided to work towards making a career out of it. I'm really excited to be learning all about making interactive and great looking websites! I love to learn which is perfect because I believe that in this field there's always more to learn.</p>
        <p>I want to learn web development and use those skills to find employment. </p>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm 22 years old and was married in September 2016. My wife and I lived a long distance relationship for just under 3 years before getting married.</p>
        <p>After getting married I decided that I didn't want to live long distance anymore and I applied for a green card so I could stay with my wife in the USA. I now live in Georgia with her.</p>
